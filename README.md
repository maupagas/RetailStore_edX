For this work, a [Retail Shop dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/amark720/retail-shop-case-study-dataset) has been selected as the Case Study to work with. Identifying behaviors of customers could lead into marketing strategies that allow to link specific products to a particular target of customers. In addition, it is important for a store to obtain a rough estimate of their revenue based on the customers that might purchase items in the store.
